-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
= Description =

 secondQuant is a Mathematica package that I wrote and used extensively during
 my research. It allows one to use second quantization in Mathematica.
 I concede it is not the simplest thing ever and it probably could be greatly
 improved. However, I don't have the time and though that sharing it would
 be better than leaving it to die in my backups and laptop.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
= Usage =

 The package can be called in Mathematica just like any other package, for
 example:
  Get["secondQuant`"]
 For examples, please refer to the file "examples.nb" and to the package file
 itself (which is heavily commented).
 The notebook "hamiltonianDatabase" contains some Hamiltonians that can be
 used with the secondQuant package.

 = Encoding and EOL =
 
 This file is encoded in UTF8 and uses Windows style EOL, i.e. \r\n.
 Usually I prefer to have two separate README files for Unix and for 
 Windows but it makes no sense in this case and since Unix based systems are 
 more tolerant to the Windows convention, I opted to go that way.

 = Licensing =

 All the code is licensed under the GPLv3 license.
